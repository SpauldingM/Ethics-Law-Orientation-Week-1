Authorization, in short definition, is what one obtains after going through a short process to obtain access into certain areas or to look at secured objects where others cannot.
An example of this would be granting students authorization into working in the IT department during their time in school, keeping track and maintaining the schools network.
An authorization that would allow them to not only further their education if they were in that same department, but also a chance to add onto their resume for future career opportunities.
However, the potential downside to this is that it has the opportunity to backfire upon the college if the student decides to have any malicious ideas.

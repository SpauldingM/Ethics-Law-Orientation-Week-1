# Ethics & Law Orientation (Week 1)

# <ins>Hello!</ins>

## My Ethical Lens

Going through the book "Ethic's in Technology" and glancing at the various forms of Ethical frameworks provided throughout the years, I will be focusing on both Utilitarianism and Rationalism.
My first choice in ethical framework, Utilitarianism, was based on my personal view that a common ground can be found between multiple parties and my personal goal of trying to make as many people happy with the decisions I make.
My second choice in ethical framework, Rationalism, is based on my logical and reasonable approach to situations or how they should be handled.
I feel both of these framework align with each other in the world of technology, balancing not just approaching a solution reasonably but enough to not rely on the usage of AI or the loss of jobs.

## Authorization Principle

Authorization, in short definition, is what one obtains after going through a short process to obtain access into certain areas or to look at secured objects where others cannot.
An example of this would be granting students authorization into working in the IT department during their time in school, keeping track and maintaining the schools network.
An authorization that would allow them to not only further their education if they were in that same department, but also a chance to add onto their resume for future career opportunities.
However, the potential downside to this is that it has the opportunity to backfire upon the college if the student decides to have any malicious ideas.

## Policy Snippet 

> Use of the Networking Lab is authorized and limited only to those who are a part of the
Cybersecurity & Early Networking program and only use it for academic or research purposes.
The authorized user must access the computers under supervision and use the provided
computers. Personal data shall be minimized as this can be a security risk for not only the
person accessing the lab, but to the collegeâ€™s cybersecurity. Those who use the authorized
access for personal use will be given a warning and asked to cease any further personal use.
Failure to heed the warning a second time will result in loss of access to the networking lab.
Anyone suspected of/caught using the network lab for malicious or harmful purposes shall be
immediately reported to the campus security for disciplinary action

## Reflection

Overall, I am looking forward to improving my knowledge on the aforementioned frameworks and how to put them into effect throughout my term and
also when I pursue my career. While these two are not in one category, I feel these two lens can work well with each other. Although, I feel that 
I will find myself focusing more on one over the other and drop the latter. I am also looking forward to learning more about GitHub in the future
and how to make these pages stand out more then just simple text.

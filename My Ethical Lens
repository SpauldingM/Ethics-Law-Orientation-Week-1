Going through the book "Ethic's in Technology" and glancing at the various forms of Ethical frameworks provided throughout the years, I will be focusing on both Utilitarianism and Rationalism.
My first choice in ethical framework, Utilitarianism, was based on my personal view that a common ground can be found between multiple parties and my personal goal of trying to make as many people happy with the decisions I make.
My second choice in ethical framework, Rationalism, is based on my logical and reasonable approach to situations or how they should be handled.
I feel both of these framework align with each other in the world of technology, balancing not just approaching a solution reasonably but enough to not rely on the usage of AI or the loss of jobs.
